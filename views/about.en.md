# About LitCurate

**LitCurate** is a tool to allow users to curate and organize academic literatures.
This tool visualizes literatures along with the categories to organize them. 

Before you proceed the curation process with LitCurate, you need to add bibliographic information of target papers into a single folder at the external bibliographic management service. Please note that [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com) is the only supported service, as of September 2016.

Once you collect bibliographic information at the external service, you can log in to LitCurate service via a link above right on this page.
You need to give LitCurate your permissions at the login with the external service (Mendeley) through its ID and password.

After you successfully logged into LitCurate, you can select a target folder.

Once you select a single folder, a list of the documents added to the folder is shown.
